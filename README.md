Familiarization with Virtual Reality and Development of VR-Based Ship Safeguarding Through Drone Sprinkler System


Developed a VR-based system using Unity 3D to enhance ship stealth capabilities through drone-controlled smoke deployment.
Implemented a multi-drone control system, allowing individual and simultaneous drone operations with smooth and realistic movement.
Designed a radar detection system to monitor ship surroundings and trigger the deployment of CHEF (Combined Hypersonic Electromagnetic Field) smoke to absorb radar waves.
Integrated real-time VR visualization using a VR headset for immersive monitoring and control.
Implemented a dynamic camera system with multiple views, including top view, drone view, and birdâ€™s eye view.
Developed and optimized smoke particle effects to simulate radar-absorbing smoke using Unity's Particle System.
Conducted comprehensive testing and performance evaluation, ensuring smooth operation with multiple drones and real-time interactions.
